# LÖVE Workouts

This is a collection of very simple [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) projects developed in the league os *work-outs* in order to test first-hand algorithms and effect prior introducing them in a game (and also, to develop supporting libraries).

## `stencil-fader`

Screen transitions and cut-out effects are a great combination.

## `contour-lines`

...

## `power-lines`

...

## `boids`

This was something I **had** to implement, as it was on the *TODO list* since... umm... the late Nineties, I guess. :)

## `splash`

The very first thing you seen in a game is the splash-screen. It serves many purposes. It welcomes you and keeps you engaged while the game does its inner workings (loading data, dealing with copy protection, etc...). I was always intrigued by the one displayed by Nintendo in the *Game Boy*. Starting with a very simple "scroll a text from the above to mid-screen" and working my way up to the Generalization Building, I ended with a nice and reusable *curved multi-path manager*.

## `anaglyph`

While working on the design-pitch of *yet-another-next-gamedev-project* inspired to the late-Eighties/early-Nineties rail-shooter, I considered that adding some *cheap-o-matic* 3D visualization by adding **anaglyph** rendering.

## TODO

* *Analogue controls*
* *Rain effect*
